## What is Blockchain?
Blockchain can be defined as a chain of the block that contains information. The technique is intended to timestamp digital documents so that it's not possible to backdate them or temper them.

The blockchain is used for the secure transfer of items like money, property, contracts, etc. without requiring a third-party intermediary like bank or government. Once a data is recorded inside a blockchain, it is very difficult to change it.

The blockchain is a software protocol (like SMTP is for email). However, Blockchains could not be run without the Internet. It is also called meta-technology as it affects other technologies. It is comprised of several pieces: a database, software application, some connected computers, etc.  

- Blockchain is not Bitcoin, but it is the technology behind Bitcoin
- Bitcoin is the digital token and blockchain is the ledger to keep track of who owns the digital tokens
- You can't have Bitcoin without blockchain, but you can have blockchain without Bitcoin.

## Blockchain Architecture
[Blockchain Architecture](https://www.guru99.com/blockchain-tutorial.html#3)  

A Blockchain is a chain of blocks which contain information. The data which is stored inside a block depends on the type of blockchain.  

The first block in the chain is called the Genesis block. Each new block in the chain is linked to the previous block.

### Understanding SHA256 - Hash
A block also has a hash. A can be understood as a fingerprint which is unique to each block.   

**Each Block has**
1. Data
2. Hash
3. Hash of the previous block 

Hence, all blocks are containing hashes of previous blocks. This is the technique that makes a blockchain so secure. 

### Proof of Work
An attacker can tamper with a block, and then recalculate all the hashes of other blocks to make the blockchain valid again.

To avoid the issue, blockchains use the concept of Proof-of-Work. It is a mechanism which slows down the creation of the new blocks.  

### Distributed P2P Network  
However, there is one more method which is used by blockchains to secure themselves, and that's by being distributed. Instead of using a central entity to manage the chain, Blockchains use a distributed peer-peer network, and everyone is allowed to join. When someone enters this network, he will get the full copy of the blockchain. Each computer is called a node.  

Let's see what happens when any user creates a new block. This new block is sent to all the users on the network. Each node needs to verify the block to make sure that it hasn't been altered. After complete checking, each node adds this block to their blockchain.  

All these nodes in this network create a **consensus**. They agree about what blocks are valid and which are not. Nodes in the network will reject blocks that are tampered with.

So, to successfully tamper with a blockchain, 
1. You will need to tamper with all blocks on the chain
2. Redo the proof-of-work for each block
3. Take control of greater than 50% of the peer-to-peer network.
After doing all these, your tampered block become accepted by everyone else. This is next to impossible task. Hence, Blockchains are so secure.
   
   
## How Blockchain Transaction Works?    
Step 1) Some person requests a transaction. The transaction could be involved cryptocurrency, contracts, records or other information.

Step 2) The requested transaction is broadcasted to a P2P network with the help of nodes.

Step 3) The network of nodes validates the transaction and the user's status with the help of known algorithms.

Step 4) Once the transaction is complete the new block is then added to the existing blockchain. In such a way that is permanent and unalterable.

## Why do we need Blockchain?  

## Blockchain Variants
Public:

In this type of blockchains, ledgers are visible to everyone on the internet. It allows anyone to verify and add a block of transactions to the blockchain. Public networks have incentives for people to join and free for use. Anyone can use a public blockchain network.

Private:

The private blockchain is within a single organization. It allows only specific people of the organization to verify and add transaction blocks. However, everyone on the internet is generally allowed to view.

Consortium:

In this Blockchain variant, only a group of organizations can verify and add transactions. Here, the ledger can be open or restricted to select groups. Consortium blockchain is used cross-organizations. It is only controlled by pre-authorized nodes.
